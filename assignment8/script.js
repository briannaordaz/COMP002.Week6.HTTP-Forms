// 1. Write code to allow visitors of the page to customize it to their liking. There is a
// form on the page that accepts a name (to be used in a greeting when the user visits
// the page) and a color picker to allow the user to choose their preferred background
// color/foreground color combination. Write the necessary code to capture these values
// when the form is submitted (prevent the default action on the form submission button to
// achieve this) and store these values in localStorage (so that it persists on the userâ€™s
// computer and their preferences are saved indefinitely). Next, write a function to apply
// the preferences if they have been set and call it each time the page loads. You may
// also want to call this function again when the user saves their preferences to
// immediately apply them. Make sure you also notify the user somehow that the preferences
// were saved.

    const backgroundColor = localStorage.getItem('backgroundColor'); // this is similar to the "personName" declaration
    const foregroundColor = localStorage.getItem('foregroundColor') //this is also similar as the other two above. It will store data associated with "mainColor" in the browser

"getElementById('greeting')" refers to the "greeting" id shown on on the html document. ".innerText = `Hello, ${person.Name}!`" means that the code is changing the inner text of the element that has the "greeting" id to "Hello, {personName}!"

document.getElementById('preferences-form').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { // "document.getElementId('preferences-form')" gets the id "preferences-form" from the html document. and ".addEventListener('submit', function (e)" adds an event listener to the submit function, allowing to function when pressed.
